				<h3>Community Health Center at Burlington Project</h3>
				<h4>Burlington, VT</h4>
				<p>
   
   We provided Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing, and FIre Protection design services and construction adminstration for the development of a new medical office and exam facility including a dental office for the Community Health Center of Burlington.  The project included the development of a water source heat pump system with a high efficiency heating system.  The building was designed with an energy recovery ventilation system fitted with a heat pump post conditioning system to maximize building performance.  The ventilation system is variable volume and utilizes ventilation demand controls.    The electrical design includes high efficiency lighting with occupancy based controls for minimal energy usage.
