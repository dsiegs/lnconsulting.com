				<h3>Fletcher Allen Health Care Operating Room No. 9 Renovation Project</h3>
				<h4>Burlington, VT</h4>
				<p>
   
   Our company worked with Scott & Partners Architects on the renovation of an existing clean storage area to accommodate new operating room space.  The project included design of mechanical, electrical, and telecommunications systems required to support the operating room including the technology integration of equipment booms.  The project was completed under multiple phases while maintaining the operational status of the operating suite and support facilities.
