   We provided the design and construction administration services for the renovation and expansion for the Northwestern Medical Center Diagnostic Imaging Project.  The project was a 10,000 square foot renovation with a 1,500 square foot addition.  This consisted of the construction of a new pharmacy, the infill of an existing court yard, and the renovation of the existing Diagnostic Imaging Suite and Women's Health Services Suite.  The renovation included multiple pieces of new diagnostic imaging equipment.
