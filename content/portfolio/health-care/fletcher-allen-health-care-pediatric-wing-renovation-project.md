				<h3>Fletcher Allen Health Care Pediatric Wing Renovation Project</h3>
				<h4>Burlington, VT</h4>
				<p>
   
   We worked with Morris Switzer Environments for Health in designing the renovation of the existing pediatric suite at Fletcher Allen Health Care.  The renovation project consisted of approximately 12,600 sq. ft. of renovation and included the design of the HVAC systems, plumbing systems, electrical systems and the technology integration of a new wireless nurse call system.  The project was completed under multiple phases while maintaining the operational status of the existing pediatric unit.
