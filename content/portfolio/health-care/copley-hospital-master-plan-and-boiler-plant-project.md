				<h3>Copley Hospital Master Plan and Boiler Plant Project</h3>
				<h4>Morrisville, VT</h4>
				<p>
   
   We worked with architects Freeman French Freeman in developing a facility master plan for the hospital with a focus on: medical office building, central heating plant, surgical services, and ambulatory care services.  Included in the project was the design of a new central heating plant, which was completed in 2009.  L.N. Consulting was the mechanical and electrical engineer for the project.
