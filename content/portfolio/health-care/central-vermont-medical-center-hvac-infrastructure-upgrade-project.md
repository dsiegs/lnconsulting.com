				<h3>Central Vermont Medical Center HVAC Infrastructure Upgrade Project</h3>
				<h4>Berlin, VT</h4>
				<p>
   
   L.N. Consulting worked directly for Central Vermont Hospital as the prime consultant for the HVAC Infrastructure Upgrade Project.  The project included the design and construction of a new 60,000 CFM air handler and support infrastructure to condition the second and third floors of the Hospital.  The new air handler is housed in a penthouse constructed on the roof of the existing hospital.  The existing programs supported by the new air handler are the ICU, Behavioral Health, Renal Dialysis, Respiratory Therapy, Birthing, Endoscopy, and Inpatient Services.  The project was designed and phased to minimize air handler shutdowns. L.N. Consulting was the prime consultant and Mechanical and Electrical Engineer for the project.
