				<h3>Green Mountain College Biomass Project</h3>
				<h4>Poultney, VT</h4>
				<p>
   
   We provided design and construction administration of a cogeneration wood chip heating plant for Green Mountain College.  The project included a 400 boiler horsepower steam boiler, 150 kW steam turbine electric generator, and all required auxiliary systems.  The biomass plant will reduce the energy costs to Green Mountain College by approximately $185,000.00 per year.  We worked closely with Green Mountain College to develop the project from conceptual design through construction.  Our company was responsible for submitting the certificate of public good and working directly with CVPS to develop a plan for connection to the utility's 4.16 kV electrical distribution system.
