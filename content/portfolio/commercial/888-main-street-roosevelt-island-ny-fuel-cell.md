				<h3>Octagon Apartments Fuel Cell</h3>
				<p>
   
   L.N. Consulting provided electrical and mechanical design services to install a 400 kW fuel cell to supplement building load for an existing 15 story combination residential/commercial building.  This project included revising the existing electric service in order to accommodate the fuel cell.  L.N. Consulting also acted as an agent to the owner providing all the applications to the local utility and state code enforcement agencies.  Additionally, L.N. Consulting worked on NYSERDA grants and incentives, including one that implements the fuel cell as a emergency power source for disaster relief.
